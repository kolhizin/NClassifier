Computer vision in Scala:
1) OpenCV -> "javacv"
2) Numerical Libraries -> "Breeze"
3) Machine Learning -> "Spark MLlib"
4) Check licensing!

- "ScalaNLP" is umbrella for "Breeze" and "Epic"
- "Algebird" is abstract algebra (total brainfuck)
"Apache Common Math" vs "Breeze":
1) Spark MLlib uses Breeze
2) Apache Common Math actual version is from 2016 (as of Apr'18)
3) Breeze syntax is swe-e-et!
