IntelliJ IDEA by unknown reason sometimes creates SBT with scala-version=2.12.4 instead of 2.12.5 which
causes "class not found" error

Once imported library dependencies and sbt plugin can be used offline

Scala.Swing is no longer support. Need to use either java swing or scalafx. Chose latter.

Simple App:
1) plugins.sbt:
addSbtPlugin("org.bytedeco" % "sbt-javacv" % "1.16")
2) build.sbt:
libraryDependencies += "org.bytedeco" % "javacv-platform" % "1.4.1"
libraryDependencies += "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "0.13"
libraryDependencies += "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "0.13"
libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx" % "8.0.144-R12"
resolvers += "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"
